# Undergraduate Research Project under Dr. Vipul Arora
Sound source separation using Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis and Deep Learning.

UGP.ipynb contains the code for Source-Filter based Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis.

DL.ipynb contains the code for Deep Probabilistic Framework-I.

ML.ipynb contains the code for Deep Probabilistic Framework-II.

UGP.py, DL.py and ML.py are the python scripts for running UGP.ipynb, DL.ipynb and ML.ipynb on GPU.

FE.py contains the code for the fundamental frequency estimation on GPU. 

The codes are written in Python-3 using TensorFlow 2.0 Framework.
